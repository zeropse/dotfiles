## 🗑️ Uninstallation

Use the built-in uninstaller:

```bash
brew-upgrade --uninstall
```

This will safely remove the tool from your system with confirmation prompts and:

- Remove the installation directory
- Remove the command shortcut
- Optionally remove empty .scripts directory (with confirmation)
- Provide completion message

## 🔄 Updates

Use the built-in updater:

```bash
brew-upgrade --update
```

This will download and install the latest version while preserving your configuration and:

- Create automatic backup of current installation
- Download latest version from repository
- Update all tool files
- Verify installation integrity
- Show backup location for safety

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS** (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- **Homebrew** installed and configured
- **Bash 4.0+** (included in modern macOS)
- **Standard Unix tools** (curl, tar, mkdir)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found after installation:**

- Make sure `~/.scripts` is in your PATH
- Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)
- Add to PATH: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.scripts:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`

**Permission errors:**

- The installer handles permissions automatically
- If issues persist: `chmod +x ~/.scripts/homebrew-upgrade/brew-upgrade.sh`

**Installation fails:**

- Check internet connection
- Verify Homebrew: `brew --version`
- Try manual installation method

**Script fails with "Homebrew not found":**

- Ensure Homebrew is properly installed
- Check that `brew` command is in your PATH
- Try running `brew --version` manually

**Cask upgrades fail:**

- Individual cask failures don't stop the process
- Check specific cask issues in the log file
- Some casks require manual intervention

**brew doctor reports issues:**

- Review the specific warnings/errors
- The tool will continue despite issues automatically
- Address underlying problems when possible

### Getting Help

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Operating system** and version
- **Homebrew version** (`brew --version`)
- **Full command used** and options
- **Log file contents** from the tool
- **Error messages** (copy exactly)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modular Design

The tool uses a clean modular architecture:

- **`brew-upgrade.sh`** - Main entry point and orchestration
- **`lib/config.sh`** - Configuration constants and variables
- **`lib/logger.sh`** - Logging functions and output formatting
- **`lib/utils.sh`** - Common utilities and helper functions
- **`lib/cli.sh`** - Command-line parsing and help system
- **`lib/steps.sh`** - Individual maintenance step implementations
- **`lib/summary.sh`** - Summary generation and reporting

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Fails fast** on critical errors (Homebrew missing, update failures)
- **Continues gracefully** on non-critical issues (individual package failures)
- **Automatic handling** of doctor warnings and cleanup issues
- **Logs everything** for post-execution review
- **Clean exit** with proper resource cleanup

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel operations** where safely possible
- **Intelligent step skipping** based on system state
- **Efficient cleanup** with selective operations
- **Minimal redundancy** in checks and operations
