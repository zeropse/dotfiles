This `vimrc` configuration is inspired by and partially copied from the original found at [hendrikmi's dotfiles](https://github.com/hendrikmi/dotfiles/tree/main/vim). 

I've also implemented an `UpdateVimrc` function that allows you to check for and apply updates from the original source directly within Vim. You can simply run the function to ensure you have the latest version.
